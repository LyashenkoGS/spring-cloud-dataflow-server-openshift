This section provides answers to some common '`how do I do that...`' type of questions
that often arise when using Spring Cloud Data Flow.

== Deploying Custom Stream App as a Maven Resource

This section walks you through deploying a simple Spring Cloud Stream based application, packaged as a Maven artifact, to OpenShift.
The source code for this app is available in the following https://github.com/donovanmuller/timezone-processor-kafka[GitHub repository].

This guide assumes that you have gone through the <<getting-started>> section and are using a local minishift
instance of OpenShift. Adjust the steps accordingly if you are using an existing OpenShift cluster.

=== Deploy a Nexus Repository

For OpenShift to build the Docker image that will be deployed, it must be able to resolve and download the custom app's Jar artifact.
This means that the custom app must be deployed to an accessible Maven repository.

Assuming the local minishift OpenShift environment discussed in the <<getting-started>> section, we will deploy
a Nexus container to which we can deploy our custom application. Deploying the Nexus image is trivial thanks to
an OpenShift template https://github.com/donovanmuller/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-openshift/tree/{scdf-server-openshift-version}/src/etc/openshift/nexus-template.yaml[available here].

NOTE: Make sure you have configured the `scdf` Service Account mentioned in the <<getting-started>> section, as this account is
used by the Nexus deployment.

Using the `oc` tool, upload the Nexus template with:

[subs="attributes"]
[source,console]
----
$ oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donovanmuller/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-openshift/{scdf-server-openshift-version}/src/etc/openshift/nexus-template.yaml
...
----

Once uploaded, open the OpenShift Console (you can use `minishift console`), authenticate and navigate to the `scdf` project.
Then click _Add to Project_ and select the `nexus` template:

image::{scdf-server-openshift-asciidoc}/images/scdf-openshift-nexus-template.png[Data Flow Server template]

The default configurations should be sane. However, you must provide the *The OpenShift Route host value*.
This value will depend on your minishift and OpenShift Router environment but should be similar to
`nexus-scdf.192.168.64.15.xip.io`. Where `-scdf.192.168.64.15.xip.io` is the project name (`scdf`) and
the default routing subdomain (`192.168.64.15.xip.io`).

image::{scdf-server-openshift-asciidoc}/images/scdf-openshift-nexus-route.png[Data Flow Server route configuration]

Click _Create_ when you're happy with the configuration.
Wait for the Nexus image to be pulled and the deployment to be successful. Once the Pod has been scaled successfully
you should be able to access the Nexus UI by clicking on the Route URL (http://nexus-scdf.192.168.64.15.xip.io in this example).

TIP: The default credential for Nexus is `admin`/`admin123` or `deployment`/`deployment123`

=== Configuring the Data Flow Server for OpenShift

We need to configure the Data Flow Server to use this new Nexus instance as a remote Maven repository.
If you have an existing deployment from the <<getting-started>> section you will have to change it's configuration.

There are a few ways to do that but the way described here is to remove the existing deployment and use the
existing https://github.com/donovanmuller/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-openshift/{scdf-server-openshift-version}/src/etc/openshift/scdf-ephemeral-datasources-kafka-template.yaml[Data Flow Server with ephemeral Datasources and Kafka binder] template
to deploy the updated configuration.

Remove the current environment using the `oc` tool (assuming you used the Kafka template):

[source,console]
----
$ oc delete all --selector=template=scdf-kafka
$ oc delete cm --selector=template=scdf-kafka
$ oc delete secret --selector=template=scdf-kafka
----

Next click _Add to Project_ and select the `spring-cloud-dataflow-server-openshift-ephemeral-kafka` template.
Use the following values for the Maven configuration items:

|===
|Configuration Parameter |Value

|Remote Maven repository name
|nexus

|Remote Maven repository URL
|http://nexus-scdf.192.168.64.15.xip.io/content/groups/public (use your Route URL for Nexus here)

|Remote Maven repository username
|deployment

|Remote Maven repository password
|deployment123
|===

image::{scdf-server-openshift-asciidoc}/images/scdf-openshift-maven.png[Data Flow Server Maven configuration]

Click _Create_ and wait for the deployment to complete successfully.

=== Cloning and Deploying the App

Next step is to deploy our custom app into the Nexus instance.
First though, we need to clone the custom app source.

[source,console]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/donovanmuller/timezone-processor-kafka.git
$ cd timezone-processor-kafka
----

Next we deploy the application into our Nexus repository with

[source,console]
----
$ ./mvnw -s .settings.xml deploy -Dnexus.url=http://nexus-scdf.192.168.64.15.xip.io/content/repositories/snapshots
...
Uploading: http://nexus-scdf.192.168.64.15.xip.io/content/repositories/snapshots/io/switchbit/timezone-processor-kafka/maven-metadata.xml
Uploaded: http://nexus-scdf.192.168.64.15.xip.io/content/repositories/snapshots/io/switchbit/timezone-processor-kafka/maven-metadata.xml (294 B at 6.0 KB/sec)

----

IMPORTANT: Substitute the value for `-Dnexus.url` with the URL matching your Nexus instance.

=== Deploying the Stream

Now that our custom app is ready, let's register it with the Data Flow Server.
Using the Data Flow Shell, targeted to our OpenShift deployed instance, register the `timezone` app with:

[source,console]
----
dataflow:>app register --name timezone --type processor --uri maven://io.switchbit:timezone-processor-kafka:1.0-SNAPSHOT
Successfully registered application 'processor:timezone'
----

[NOTE]
====
The assumption is that the out-of-the-box apps have been imported previously as part of the <<getting-started>> section.
If the apps are not imported, import them now with:

[source,console]
----
dataflow:>app import --uri http://bit.ly/stream-applications-kafka-docker
----

It does not really matter whether the Docker or Maven out-of-the-box apps are registered.
====

Now we can define a stream using our timezone processor with:

[source,console]
----
dataflow:>stream create --name timezoney --definition "time | timezone | log"
Created new stream 'timezoney'
----

and deploy it with:

[source,console]
----
dataflow:>stream deploy timezoney --properties "app.timezone.timezone=Africa/Johannesburg,app.timezone.spring.cloud.deployer.openshift.defaultDockerfile=Dockerfile.nexus"
Deployment request has been sent for stream 'timezoney'
----

NOTE: We provide two deployment properties to the `timezone` app. The first is the required timezone to convert the input times.
The second is to inform the Data Flow Server that it should use the provided default Dockerfile (`Dockerfile.nexus`) that supports Nexus repositories,
instead of the default `Docker.artifactory`.

You should see a build being triggered for the `timezone` app, which will download the `timezone-processor-kafka`
Maven artifact from the Nexus repository and build the Docker image. Once the build is successful, the app will be deployed
alongside the other apps.

View both the `timezoney-timezone-0` and `timezoney-log-0` apps for the expected log outputs.

image::{scdf-server-openshift-asciidoc}/images/scdf-openshift-custom-app-log.png[timezoney stream logs]

Once you're done, destroy the stream with:

[source,console]
----
dataflow:>stream destroy timezoney
Destroyed stream 'timezoney'
----
